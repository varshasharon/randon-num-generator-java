# Random Number Generator & Guessing Game using JAVA

Welcome to the Random Number Generator game — where Java meets mystery, and numbers hide in plain sight! 🤖

Think you're good at guessing? Let's put that to the test.

##  What is it?
A console-based number guessing game made in Java for beginners. The computer generates a number between 1 and 100, and it's your job to guess it! With helpful (and dramatic) hints, of course. 

"Oh, you're so far away!"

"You're getting closer! Keep going champ!"

"You guessed it right!" 🎉

## How it works
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using java.util.Random.

You guess the number in the console.

#### The program gives you hints:

Way off? It tells you you’re so far away! 

Close enough? It cheers you on with motivational hints 

Exact match? Victory is yours! 


## Take a look at the code !
```
import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static int randomNumber(){
        Random random = new Random();
        return random.nextInt(100)+1;
    }
    public static String hint(int num, int guess)
    {
        if(guess == num)
        {
            return "Correct";
        }
        if(guess < (num-5) || guess > (num+5))
        {
            return "Oh, You're so far away\n";
        }
        else{
            return "You're getting closer! Keep going champ!\n";
        }
    }

    public static void runGuess()
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = randomNumber();
        String hint;

        while(true)
        {
            System.out.println("Guess a number between 1 - 100 : ");
            int guess = sc.nextInt();
            hint = hint(num, guess);

            if(hint.equals("Correct"))
            {
                System.out.println("You guessed it right!");
                break;
            }
            else{
                System.out.println(hint);
            }
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        runGuess();
    }
}

```
